Things about me: I like making video games, and am the best dungeon gimmick designer in the world. 
I have made over 30+ custom gimmicks for my video games from The Land of Anarchy, Herald of Heroes, Link's Adventure in Block Land, and Mayath Island Remastered to name a few.

I'm from Idaho, but currently call Kentucky home. I like to read and make things. I love Doctor Who, Star Wars, Harry Potter, Marvel, and a bunch of other geeky things. I'm majoring in computer science and hoping to eventually get a master's degree in library science.
